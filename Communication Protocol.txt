UART 
- TX to RX and RX to TX
START bit: high->low.
STOP bit: low->high.
DATA bit: 7 or 8 common, can range from 5-9.
PARITY bit: check the transmission 
- odd: number of bit 1 always odd.
- even: number of bit 1 always even.

I2C:
- SDA, SCL
- START condition: SDA goes low before SCL goes low
- STOP condition: SDA goes high after SCL goes high/
- 7 address bits + 1 bit ACK
- 8 data bits + R/W bit + bit ACK.
- ACK: ACK or NACK indicates that the address peripheral did not respond or unable to process the request.
- The signal of SDA stays stable in high period of SCL and change in low period of SCL.

SPI:
-CS, CLK, MOSI, MISO.
- CS signal will choose which slave to work with and also acts as START and STOP CONDITION.
- SPI enable user to choose to transmit and receive sampled data at high or low edge of CLK.
- Idle state of CLK can also be chosen. 
- clock idle value.
- MSB or LSB.
- transmit at positive or negative edge of SPI CLK.
